        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Ten years after they pulled up their stakes and moved south to Nashville, leaving their gritty post-industrial hometown of Akron, Ohio, 
            the birth place of rubber companies, waffle cones, oatmeal, and LeBron James; Patrick Carney and Dan Auerbach are back, at least metaphorically. 
            On their ninth album “Let’s Rock”  the city of Akron is a silent partner, a third member on a recording that returns the duo to the straightforward, 
            primitivism of their early canon, back to those days when Carney worshipped the Stooges, and Auerbach was enamored with Link Wray and the original 
            James Gang guitarist Glenn Schwartz.</p>

        <p>“What version of me do you see on this record?” singer, guitarist Dan Auerbach asks rhetorically from Easy Eye Sound Studio. 
            “You see the Dan Auerbach who saw Link Wray when he was eighteen, and who went and saw Glenn Schwartz every week at Hooples [in Akron]. 
            Glenn Schwartz was our own religious version of Link Wray. That was how I got turned on to crazy ass, weird ass rock and roll when I was a kid. 
            That made such an impact on me. And it still does…” he trails off.</p>
